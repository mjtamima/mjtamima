### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mifta. I'm an intermediate level python programmer with a passion for machine learning and deep learning. 
With a solid foundation in python, I'm currently taking online courses to learn mathematics (i.e., Linear Algebra & Calculus) that work behind machine learning algorithms. 
I'm an autodidact and I greatly enjoy learning about new cutting-edge technologies.
